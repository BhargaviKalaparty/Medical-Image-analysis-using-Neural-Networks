# Medical-Image-analysis-using-Neural-Networks

# About:

In this project, two medical image datasets, BloodMNIST and BreastMNIST are used to create deep learning models for classification problem. These models are deployed as a web application for end-users, where they can choose the desired classification page and provided models for classification of their uploaded images. 

# Models Used:
